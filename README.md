# Project Title

Remote Work and Employee Mental Health: An Exploration of a Dataset

## Description

With the chosen dataset, this project was to identify patterns in the mental health and stress levels of employees working on-site vs. hybrid vs. remote. We scrutinized the relationships between survey responses from the employees and their demographic characteristics, features of work habit trends, and other associations drawn from the data.
